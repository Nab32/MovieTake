# MovieTake

A simple movie rating website made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)

## How it works
To run this project, you will need a `.env` file with 2 mandatory keys. One being the `OMDB_KEY` (API key to access the OMDB database) and the other being `MONGODB_SECRET_URL` (The url to connect to the cluster).
